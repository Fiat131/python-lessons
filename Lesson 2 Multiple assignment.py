## Multiple assignment = allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code

## Normally it is like this

#name = "Ali"
#age = 20
#acayip_karizmatik = True
## variable names can't have spaces

## but we can do this in one line of code

#name, age, acayip_karizmatik = "Ali", 21, True

#print(name)
#print(age)
#print(acayip_karizmatik)

## 2nd example

## without Multiple Assignments
#Spongebob = 30
#Patrick = 30
#Sandy = 30
#Squidward = 30

## with Multiple Assignments
#Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30

#print(Spongebob)
#print(Patrick)
#print(Sandy)
#print(Squidward)
